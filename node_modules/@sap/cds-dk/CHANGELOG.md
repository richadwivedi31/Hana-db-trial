### Fixed

- `cds repl` now finds modules like `hdb` that are installed locally in the app folder
- `cds repl` now enables the `await` statement also on Windows
- `cds lint` now limits all file extensions to those allowed by the @sap/eslint-plugin-cds ESLint configuration

- `cds init --add pipeline` and `cds add pipeline` will now use the general purpose pipeline of project "Piper".
- `cds login`, `cds extend` and `cds activate` now also support clientid/clientsecret as parameters. This is needed when extending multitenant
applications provided as as reusable services
(see [CP documentation](https://controlcenter.ondemand.com/index.html#/knowledge_center/articles/2316430f7d804820934910db736cefbf)).
- `cds init --add mta` and `cds add mta` now always set the `cloud` Spring profile for Java apps. Before, it was only set if a binding to an SAP HANA service was present.

### Changed

- `cds add cf-manifest` now adds a dependency to the `java_buildpack`.
- `sqlite3` is now an optional dependency to `cds-dk`.  This means that an installation failure of `sqlite3`, e.g. in environments w/o Internet connectivity, no longer leads to an overall installation error.  This behavior suits Java applications, as these usually don't need an SQLite database.  Node.js applications still require a proper installation of `sqlite3` if they use this database.

- `cds init --add hana` now adds `requires.db.kind: "sql"` to cds configuration for Node.js and Java

## Version 3.2.1 - 2020-11-20

### Fixed

- `cds import` no longer creates `.csn` files with invalid `kind:ComplexType` fields

## Version 3.2.0 - 2020-11-03

### Added

- `cds watch` now allows to set the `--in-memory` flag that is passed to `serve`.

### Changed

- `@sap/cds-dk` is again shrinkwrapped, so that builds get reproducible again
- All `cds` commands now prefer a local installation of `@sap/cds`.  This enables applications better control over the version of `@sap/cds`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` generates the service application with the `random-route: true` flag, which avoids route clashes on CF during development.

### Fixed

- `cds run` finds its `express` module again in the case where no `express` is installed in the application.
- `cds env` now also displays properties that have a value `false` or `''`.
- Leading flags in `cds` CLI work again, like `cds --to sql my.cds`
- `cds compile --to` w/o an argument now fails with a better message

### Removed

### Fixed
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` now writes `requires.db.model` in `package.json` such that `cds.connect.to.('db')` works w/o further `model` options.
- `cds deploy --to sqlite` with `@sap/cds` 4.2 no longer crashes due to a wrong import

## Version 3.1.0 - 2020-09-30

### Added
- `cds compile` now supports option `flavor` with values: `files` | `sources` | `parsed` | `xtended` | `inferred`.
  + `cds compile --files` maps to `--flavor files`.
  + `cds compile --sources` maps to `--flavor sources`.
  + `cds compile --parse` maps to `--flavor parsed`.
  + `cds compile` maps to `--flavor inferred`.
- `cds add cf-manifest` creates manifest.yml and services-manifest.yml allowing for Cloud Foundry native deployment.
- `cds init` now supports type `nodejs` to create a Node.js based project. This is the default and can be omitted.
- `cds watch`: enter `debug` or `debug-brk` to restart process in debug mode.  Other commands are `ps` and `rs`.

- `cds watch` does not use `nodemon` anymore.
  > You can continue using `cds watch` with `nodemon` by installing `nodemon` globally and setting env variable `CDS_USE_NODEMON` to true.
- `cds add mta` for Java applications now determines app details like name, version etc. based on `pom.xml` and no longer from `package.json`.

### Fixed
- `cds add mta` now configures the Service Manager for SaaS applications. The Instance Manager is no longer used.
- `cds import` no longer writes an empty file if the source and the target edmx files are the same
- `cds import` yields better error messages if the input file does not exists or is invalid
- `cds import` no longer writes a Windows-specific path to `package.json`
- `cds init --add java` shows better error message if Maven is not installed.

## Version 2.0.8 - 2020-08-07

### Changed
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.8.1` for creating Java projects.

### Fixed

### Added
- `cds init` supports adding `samples` via `--add samples`. See `cds help init` for more details.

  The latter requires an optional Node.js module `keytar` to be installed.
- New command `cds logout` removes authentication data and optionally project settings.

### Changed
- `@sap/cdk` no longer warns about `@sap/cds` being globally installed next to it.  This was a temporary hint for the transition period to `@sap/cds-dk`.
- `cds init` generates dependency to `@sap/cds` version `4` for Nodejs projects.
- Use square brackets to pass array values for options to `cds init --java:mvn`.
- `cds init --add pipeline` and `cds add pipeline` now create file `config.yml` in `.pipeline` folder.
- Improved `launch.json` file which is created during `cds init`.
- `cds add mta` now creates a mta.yaml file that sets the production flag for cds build and npm install.
  This ensures that the HANA artefacts are created if `"kind": "sql"` or some `production` profile has been configured in package.json or .cdsrc.json.
  Requires `@sap/cds` version >=4.x.
- `cds init` uses latest `Maven Java archetype` version `1.7.0` for creating Java projects.
- `cds init` no longer adds `package-lock.json` to `.gitignore` file when creating a new project.
